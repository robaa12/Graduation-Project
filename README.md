# Motager - Build Your Own E-commerce website

**Motager** is a scalable e-commerce platform, similar to Shopify, built using microservices. It enables users to create their own online stores with features like:

- User authentication
- Product management
- Order processing
- Payment integration

The project also includes **two AI models** to enhance the platform’s functionality:

1. **Product Description Suggestions** – An AI model that generates suggested descriptions for products to help store owners enhance their product listings.
2. **Sentiment Analysis** – An AI model that analyzes customer reviews and feedback to determine the sentiment, helping store owners better understand customer opinions.

This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement distributed systems with clean architecture.
